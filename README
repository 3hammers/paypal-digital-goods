This branch of the PayPal Digital Goods PHP Library offers a
neater version specifically designed to ship with an application. 

To use this branch as a Git submodule in your application's 
repository, use the following command:

	# Add the PayPal Library as a submodule
	git submodule add git://github.com/thenbrent/paypal-digital-goods.git paypal

	# Set the submodule to use the submodule branch  
	cd paypal 
	git checkout -b submodule origin/submodule

When cloning your application's Git repo, be sure to specify the --recursive option to include the contents of the PayPal submodule.

	# Clone my plugin and all submodules 
 	git clone --recursive git://github.com/username/app-name.git
